# Road.Design
The Project about designing the road between the Yapraklı and Kavak villages from the Istinye university Transportation Engineering lecture(fall 2011-12)
## 1.Introduction
Our objective was to improve the Yapraklı-Kavak village road, which originally spanned 9 kilometers and had inconsistent slopes and a low project speed. We were able to achieve this goal by constructing a new road that is 6 kilometers long and has a maximum slope of 8%.
